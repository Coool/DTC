Subject: Last warning before VPS shutdown

Hello %%%FIRST_NAME%%%,

Your Xen Virtual Server (VPS) %%%VPS_NUMBER%%%:%%%VPS_NODE%%%
has expired %%%EXPIRED_DAYS%%% days ago, on the: %%%EXPIRATION_DATE%%%.

Please login into your control panel at:

%%%DTC_CLIENT_URL%%%

with your login %%%DTC_ADM_LOGIN%%%, click on your VPS tab, and renew it.

This is our last warning before we destroy the data of your VPS. We
have already stoped it, and you wont be able to start it if you don't
renew it. Please understand that we can't keep your VPS running as we
need the space for other customers, and that hosting has to be paid in
advance. If you don't renew, your VPS data will be destroyed in 3 days,
and that is not recoverable.
