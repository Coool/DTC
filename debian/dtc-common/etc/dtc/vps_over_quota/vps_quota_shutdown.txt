Subject: Your VPS will be shutdown because of network quota abuse

Hello,

Your Xen Virtual Private Server (VPS) %%%VPS_NUMBER%%%:%%%VPS_NODE%%%
is well over its network quota. We are sorry, but we cannot keep
it running if it is using more network transfer than it is allowed,
so it has been shutdown. Note that you will not be able to restart
your VPS until someone from the support unlocks it. Please file a
support ticket to reach the billing department if you want to solve
this problem.
