The Virtual Server hosting account you have ordered has been validated.
It's currently setting-up your operating system. You can login in the
control panel using the information following.

If you want to install DTC inside your VPS, or select another operating
system, just reinstall one more time selecting the appropriate option
with the popup. Then at next reboot, the setup script will install DTC.
On that case, once DTC is setup, please do not mistake between the 2
control panels: the one in your VPS, and the one with your client login
within our company. These are 2 control panel with different purposes.
For example, do not send support ticket inside the control panel of your
VPS, because it will never reach us. Use your client control panel login
of our company instead.

Once the operating system will be setup, you will have to click on the
control panel to bootup your VPS. Once it boots up, you need to login on
the physical console using ssh: ssh xenXX@example.com, where XX is the
number of your VPS, and example is the hostname of the Xen server where
your VPS is running. This is NOT the sshd inside the VM that will be
used, but the one of the physical server's main OS, that will
automatically connect you to the console of your VPS.

Once you are logged on the physical console of your VPS, login as root.
Then, you can install ssh on it and finish the installation. A full
detail of the procedure can be read here:
