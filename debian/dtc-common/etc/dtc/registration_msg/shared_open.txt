The shared hosting account you have ordered is now ready to be used.
Note that it can take up to 10 minutes until your domain name is setup
on our DNS and apache server (a cron job runs each 10 minutes for new
mail, domains and subdomains, but you don't need to wait for your ftp
accounts).

Note that your files should be uploaded in:

/var/www/sites/YOU-USERNAME/your-domain.com/subdomains/www/html

And when creating a new ftp account, you wont see the first part of the
path, so it will be relative to:

/var/www/sites/YOU-USERNAME

You can login to the control panel using the following informations:
