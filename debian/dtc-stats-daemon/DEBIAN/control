Description: dtc-xen VM statistics for the dtc web control panel
 Domain Technologie Control (DTC) is a control panel aiming at commercial
 hosting. This small daemon will query all the dtc-xen servers that you have
 configured in DTC and fetch the statistics from them: I/O stats, network and
 CPU. This information is then stored in DTC for your customer accounting.
